Ideas and future features captured during development conversations.

## Packaging & Distribution

### Standalone Executable Package
**Status:** Idea phase - needs planning

**Description:**
Package the entire InStore Portal as a standalone executable (.exe) that store owners can easily install. Since the app uses internal SQLite database, it's self-contained and perfect for distribution.

**Benefits:**
- Easy installation for store owners
- No technical knowledge required
- Customizable branding (replace logo, colors)
- Self-contained - no external database dependencies

**Considerations:**
- Electron or similar for packaging
- Auto-update mechanism
- Configuration wizard for branding
- Data backup/restore functionality

## Database

### Convex Migration (Optional)
**Status:** Research documented

**Reference:** See `convex-claude-info.md` for Convex database information.

**Note:** Current SQLite setup is actually good for standalone distribution. Only consider Convex if cloud sync between stores is needed.
