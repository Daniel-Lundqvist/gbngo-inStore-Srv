## Analysis

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **When** | Unknown creation date |
| **Where** | NO references in code or documentation |
| **How** | Old Claude permissions file with Playwright MCP permissions |
| **If needed** | **NO - Superseded by `.claude/settings.local.json`** |

## What is this file?

This is an old Claude Code permissions file. Claude Code now uses:
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - current permissions
- `.mcp.json` - MCP server configuration

This root-level `.claude_settings.json` is no longer read by Claude Code.

### Original contents:
```json
{
  "sandbox": { "enabled": false },
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "bypassPermissions",
    "allow": [
      "Read(./**)", "Write(./**)", "Edit(./**)", "Glob(./**)", "Grep(./**)",
      "Bash(*)", "WebFetch", "WebSearch",
      "mcp__playwright__browser_*" (all Playwright tools)
    ]
  }
}
```

## Cleanup actions taken

1. Moved `.claude_settings.json` to `docs/dead-files/`
2. Removed reference from `.gitignore` (was on line 56)
3. Also removed `.agent.lock` from `.gitignore` (file never existed)
