## Analysis

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **When** | Unknown creation date |
| **Where** | NO references in code or documentation |
| **How** | Old Claude config with MCP permissions for `mcp__features__*` |
| **If needed** | **NO** |

## What is this file?

This is an old Claude assistant configuration file from the AutoCoder build process. It contains:
- Sandbox settings (disabled)
- Permission settings with `bypassPermissions` mode
- MCP tool permissions for `mcp__features__*` endpoints that no longer exist

### Original contents:
```json
{
  "sandbox": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "bypassPermissions",
    "allow": [
      "Read(./**)",
      "Glob(./**)",
      "Grep(./**)",
      "WebFetch",
      "WebSearch",
      "mcp__features__feature_get_stats",
      "mcp__features__feature_get_next",
      "mcp__features__feature_get_for_regression"
    ]
  }
}
```

The current Claude config is in `.mcp.json` (Playwright MCP). This old file is not used.

## Cleanup actions taken

1. Moved `.claude_assistant_settings.json` to `docs/dead-files/`
2. Removed reference from `.gitignore` (was on line 57)
